# Real Estate Marketplace Backend

## Compilation Issues Fixed

We've addressed several key compilation issues in the codebase:

1. **Name conflict resolution**: Renamed the Solana SDK's `Transaction` to `SolanaTransaction` to avoid conflicts with our own database model.
2. **Database model renaming**: Changed our `Transaction` struct to `DbTransaction` to avoid conflicts.
3. **Type parameter issues**: Fixed the imports and type definitions in various places.

## Remaining Issues to Resolve

The backend code still has the following issues that need manual intervention:

### 1. Rust Version Compatibility

The project requires Rust version 1.81 or higher, but your current installation is 1.78.0. This affects these dependencies:
- base64ct@1.7.3 requires rustc 1.81
- litemap@0.7.5 requires rustc 1.81
- pq-sys@0.7.1 requires rustc 1.82.0
- zerofrom@0.1.6 requires rustc 1.81

To fix this, run:
```bash
rustup update stable
```

### 2. Proc-Macro Issues in IDE

Your IDE is showing proc-macro errors even though the code may compile correctly after upgrading Rust. This is a common issue with proc-macros in some IDEs.

If errors persist after upgrading Rust, try:
1. Restarting your IDE
2. Run `cargo clean` followed by `cargo check`
3. If using VS Code, make sure the rust-analyzer extension is updated

### 3. Main Function Approach

If you still encounter issues with the `#[tokio::main]` macro after upgrading Rust, you can use an alternative approach:

```rust
fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let rt = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap();
    rt.block_on(async_main())
}

async fn async_main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    // Your existing main function code here
}
```

## Building and Running

After addressing the Rust version issue:

1. Run `cargo clean` to clear previous build artifacts
2. Run `cargo check` to verify that compilation issues are resolved
3. Run `cargo run` to start the server

The backend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8080 by default.
