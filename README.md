### Environment Configuration

Ensure the following environment variables are set correctly:
- **Frontend**: Solana RPC URL and backend API URL.
- **Backend**: Database URL, Solana RPC URL, admin private key, and JWT secret.
- **Smart Contract**: Solana cluster (e.g., Devnet) configured via Solana CLI.

## üîÑ User Flow

### 1. Wallet Connection & Authentication

- The backend verifies the wallet signature and issues a JWT token.
- User profiles are created/retrieved from the PostgreSQL database.

### 2. Property Browsing & Search
- Browse featured properties on the homepage.
- View detailed property pages with metadata (location, price, size, etc.).
- Search and filter properties based on preferences.

  - Fill out a form with property details (title, description, price, location, etc.).
  - Upload image URLs for property media.
  - Submit and pay a listing fee in SOL.
- **Blockchain Process**:
  - The Solana smart contract mints a property NFT.
  - The backend stores metadata in PostgreSQL.
  - Users receive an NFT receipt confirming ownership.

### 4. Making & Managing Offers

  - The smart contract executes the sale, transferring funds from escrow.
  - The property NFT is transferred to the buyer.
- **Post-Transaction**:
  - Ownership is updated on-chain and in the database.
  - Users receive transaction confirmations and NFT receipts.

## üìä Smart Contract Details

The Solana smart contract, built with Anchor, manages the core marketplace logic:

- **Marketplace Initialization**:
  - Sets up the marketplace with an authority and fee percentage.
- **Property Listing**:
  - Mints an NFT for each property, storing metadata on-chain.
  - Validates property details (ID, price, location, etc.).
- **Offer Management**:
  - Allows buyers to submit offers with SOL held in escrow.
  - Supports offer acceptance, rejection, or expiration.
- **Sale Execution**:
  - Transfers the property NFT to the buyer.
  - Distributes funds to the seller (minus marketplace fees).
  - Records transaction history on-chain.
- **States**:
  - Properties: LISTED, OFFER_RECEIVED, UNDER_CONTRACT, ESCROW_FUNDED, COMPLETING_SALE, SOLD.
  - Offers: Pending, Accepted, Rejected, Completed, Expired.

The contract includes error handling for invalid inputs, unauthorized actions, and arithmetic overflows, ensuring robust operation.
